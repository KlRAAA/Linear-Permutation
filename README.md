## Introduction
The **Password Generator** is a tool that generates secure and customizable passwords for users. It helps users create passwords of varying lengths, incorporating different character types such as letters, numbers, and symbols. Users can select options like password length and whether to include uppercase, lowercase, digits, or special characters.

This tool can be integrated into any website or application where users need to generate strong, random passwords for better security.

## System Overview
The **Password Generator** works by taking user input for desired password characteristics and generates a secure password based on those inputs.

### Key Steps Involved:
- **Input**: Users specify password length and select character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols).
- **Generation**: The system generates a random password that fits the chosen criteria.
- **Output**: The generated password is displayed and can be copied to the clipboard for easy use.

## Features
- **Customizable Password Length**: Users can set the password length according to their needs.
- **Character Type Selection**: Users can choose which character sets to include (letters, numbers, symbols).
- **Secure Generation**: Generates random, strong passwords that meet modern security standards.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: A convenient button allows users to copy the generated password directly to the clipboard.
- **Real-Time Preview**: Shows a preview of the password as it's being generated based on user preferences.

## Logic of the Code
The core logic revolves around generating a random string from the chosen character sets (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols). The generated password is a random combination of the characters based on the user-defined length and selected character types.

### Steps:
1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - Users input the desired password length.
   - Users select the character types (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols).
2. **Character Set Assembly**:
   - The system assembles a pool of characters based on the selected options.
3. **Random Character Selection**:
   - A loop runs to randomly select characters from the pool until the desired password length is reached.
4. **Password Generation**:
   - The selected characters are combined to form the final password, which is displayed to the user.

## Algorithm Explanation
The password generation algorithm uses random selection from different character sets (letters, digits, symbols) to create a secure and unique password. The core algorithm ensures that:

- **Randomness**: Each character in the password is chosen randomly from the available character sets.
- **User Customization**: The user can dictate the length and complexity by enabling or disabling certain character types.
- **Security**: The generated passwords are difficult to guess or crack due to their random nature and inclusion of diverse characters.

### Formula for Password Generation:
1. If the password length is `n` and the total number of selected characters (upper, lower, digits, symbols) is `m`, the possible number of password combinations is:

## Total Combinations = m^n


This ensures that every possible combination of characters is considered for password creation.

## Installation

It simplifies daily outfit planning by permuting clothing items such as tops, bottoms, shoes, and accessories into different combinations. The tool also supports repeated use of certain items (like shoes and accessories), and allows filtering based on preferences (e.g., formal vs. casual).

The system can be easily integrated into a fashion or lifestyle website and is perfect for anyone who wants help in styling and maximizing their wardrobe options.

## System Overview
The Wardrobe Outfit Generator works by taking user inputs (tops, bottoms, shoes, and accessories) and generating all possible permutations of outfits. Users can also apply filters to display only casual or formal outfits.

Key steps involved:

Input: Users enter wardrobe items as comma-separated values.
Generation: The system generates all possible outfit combinations (with item reuse).
Filtering: The user can filter outfits by occasion (casual or formal).
Output: A list of generated outfits is displayed.
Features
User-Friendly Interface: Allows users to input their wardrobe items directly into a form.
Permutations with Repetition: Generates all possible combinations with repeated items like shoes or accessories.
Filtering Options: Users can filter outfits by occasion (casual, formal).
Regenerate Option: Users can generate and regenerate outfits as many times as they want with one click.
Stylistic Design: Styled to fit into a fashion or lifestyle website.

## Logic of the Code
The core logic revolves around generating all combinations of the wardrobe items using a permutation with repetition approach.

Steps:
Input Parsing:
The user inputs lists of tops, bottoms, shoes, and accessories.
These are converted into arrays by splitting the comma-separated input values.
Combination Generation:
A nested loop iterates through each item (tops, bottoms, shoes, accessories), creating all possible combinations.
Filtering:
The code checks if the combination fits the filter (casual or formal) based on predefined "casual" and "formal" items.
Only combinations that match the selected filter are displayed.
Regenerate Logic:
The regenerate button becomes visible after the first generation of outfits, allowing users to generate new combinations on demand.

## Formula Explanation
The outfit generator uses permutations with repetition to calculate possible combinations. The idea behind this is to create all possible combinations of outfits using:

Tops: Variable number of tops (e.g., 3 tops).
Bottoms: Variable number of bottoms (e.g., 2 bottoms).
Shoes: Variable number of shoes (can be reused across outfits).
Accessories: Variable number of accessories (can be reused across outfits).
Formula for the number of combinations:
If we have n tops, m bottoms, p shoes, and q accessories, the total number of outfits can be calculated as:

Total Combinations = n * m * p * q

This means every possible combination of these elements is considered, including repeated items (e.g., same shoes can be used with multiple outfits).
