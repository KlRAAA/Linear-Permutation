## Introduction
The **Password Generator** is a tool that generates secure and customizable passwords for users. It helps users create passwords of varying lengths, incorporating different character types such as letters, numbers, and symbols. Users can select options like password length and whether to include uppercase, lowercase, digits, or special characters.

This tool can be integrated into any website or application where users need to generate strong, random passwords for better security.

## System Overview
The **Password Generator** works by taking user input for desired password characteristics and generates a secure password based on those inputs.

### Key Steps Involved:
- **Input**: Users specify password length and select character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols).
- **Generation**: The system generates a random password that fits the chosen criteria.
- **Output**: The generated password is displayed and can be copied to the clipboard for easy use.

## Features
- **Customizable Password Length**: Users can set the password length according to their needs.
- **Character Type Selection**: Users can choose which character sets to include (letters, numbers, symbols).
- **Secure Generation**: Generates random, strong passwords that meet modern security standards.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: A convenient button allows users to copy the generated password directly to the clipboard.
- **Real-Time Preview**: Shows a preview of the password as it's being generated based on user preferences.

## Logic of the Code
The core logic revolves around generating a random string from the chosen character sets (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols). The generated password is a random combination of the characters based on the user-defined length and selected character types.

### Steps:
1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - Users input the desired password length.
   - Users select the character types (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols).
2. **Character Set Assembly**:
   - The system assembles a pool of characters based on the selected options.
3. **Random Character Selection**:
   - A loop runs to randomly select characters from the pool until the desired password length is reached.
4. **Password Generation**:
   - The selected characters are combined to form the final password, which is displayed to the user.

## Algorithm Explanation
The password generation algorithm uses random selection from different character sets (letters, digits, symbols) to create a secure and unique password. The core algorithm ensures that:

- **Randomness**: Each character in the password is chosen randomly from the available character sets.
- **User Customization**: The user can dictate the length and complexity by enabling or disabling certain character types.
- **Security**: The generated passwords are difficult to guess or crack due to their random nature and inclusion of diverse characters.

### Formula for Password Generation:
1. If the password length is `n` and the total number of selected characters (upper, lower, digits, symbols) is `m`, the possible number of password combinations is:

## Total Combinations = m^n


This ensures that every possible combination of characters is considered for password creation.

## Installation

### Requirements:
- **Browser**: Any modern web browser.
- **Optional**: You can also host the project using a local server (such as Live Server in VSCode).

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the project files:

git clone https://github.com/KlRAAA/password-generator.git

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Application

1. **Open the Application**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

2. **Input Password Length**:
   - Use the length slider or input field to specify how long the generated password should be.

3. **Select Character Types**:
   - Check or uncheck boxes to include/exclude character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols).

4. **Generate Password**:
   - Click the **Generate Password** button to generate the password based on your preferences.

5. **Copy Password**:
   - After generation, click the **Copy to Clipboard** button to easily copy the password.

### Running via Local Server (Live Server in VSCode)

1. **Open Project in VSCode**:
   - Open the folder containing the project files in Visual Studio Code.

2. **Open with Live Server**:
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file and select **Open with Live Server**.

3. **View in Browser**:
   - The application will open automatically in your web browser, and you can start using it.

### Customization Options

You can easily modify the system to fit your specific needs:

- **Minimum Password Length**: Set a minimum password length to enforce stronger security.
- **Add More Character Sets**: Extend the functionality to include more character types, such as emoji or special symbols.
- **Password Strength Indicator**: Add an indicator to show the strength of the generated password (e.g., weak, medium, strong).
- **Save Passwords**: Add a feature to save generated passwords for future reference.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS3**: Styling of the interface, including layout and user interface elements.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core logic for generating passwords and handling user input.

### Future Improvements

- **Password Strength Analysis**: Add a feature to analyze and display the strength of the generated password.
- **Password History**: Store previously generated passwords for user reference.
- **Password Management**: Implement a basic password manager to store and manage passwords.
- **Entropy Calculation**: Show an entropy score to indicate the security level of the generated password.
