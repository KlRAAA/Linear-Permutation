Introduction
The Wardrobe Outfit Generator is a tool that helps users generate all possible outfit combinations from their wardrobe. It simplifies daily outfit planning by permuting clothing items such as tops, bottoms, shoes, and accessories into different combinations. The tool also supports repeated use of certain items (like shoes and accessories), and allows filtering based on preferences (e.g., formal vs. casual).

The system can be easily integrated into a fashion or lifestyle website and is perfect for anyone who wants help in styling and maximizing their wardrobe options.

System Overview
The Wardrobe Outfit Generator works by taking user inputs (tops, bottoms, shoes, and accessories) and generating all possible permutations of outfits. Users can also apply filters to display only casual or formal outfits.

Key steps involved:

Input: Users enter wardrobe items as comma-separated values.
Generation: The system generates all possible outfit combinations (with item reuse).
Filtering: The user can filter outfits by occasion (casual or formal).
Output: A list of generated outfits is displayed.
Features
User-Friendly Interface: Allows users to input their wardrobe items directly into a form.
Permutations with Repetition: Generates all possible combinations with repeated items like shoes or accessories.
Filtering Options: Users can filter outfits by occasion (casual, formal).
Regenerate Option: Users can generate and regenerate outfits as many times as they want with one click.
Stylistic Design: Styled to fit into a fashion or lifestyle website.
Logic of the Code
The core logic revolves around generating all combinations of the wardrobe items using a permutation with repetition approach.

Steps:
Input Parsing:
The user inputs lists of tops, bottoms, shoes, and accessories.
These are converted into arrays by splitting the comma-separated input values.
Combination Generation:
A nested loop iterates through each item (tops, bottoms, shoes, accessories), creating all possible combinations.
Filtering:
The code checks if the combination fits the filter (casual or formal) based on predefined "casual" and "formal" items.
Only combinations that match the selected filter are displayed.
Regenerate Logic:
The regenerate button becomes visible after the first generation of outfits, allowing users to generate new combinations on demand.
Formula Explanation
The outfit generator uses permutations with repetition to calculate possible combinations. The idea behind this is to create all possible combinations of outfits using:

Tops: Variable number of tops (e.g., 3 tops).
Bottoms: Variable number of bottoms (e.g., 2 bottoms).
Shoes: Variable number of shoes (can be reused across outfits).
Accessories: Variable number of accessories (can be reused across outfits).
Formula for the number of combinations:
If we have n tops, m bottoms, p shoes, and q accessories, the total number of outfits can be calculated as:

Total Combinations = n * m * p * q

This means every possible combination of these elements is considered, including repeated items (e.g., same shoes can be used with multiple outfits).
